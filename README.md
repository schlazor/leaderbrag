# Leaderbrag [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schlazor/leaderbrag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/schlazor/leaderbrag)

Leaderbrag is a small gem that uses [xmlstats](https://erikberg.com/api) via [xmlstats-ruby](https://github.com/alexmchale/xmlstats-ruby) to find the leading team in baseball or determine if a given team is the best in baseball.

It includes the CLI executable `leader` which should be suitable for most scripting desires.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'leaderbrag'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install leaderbrag

## Usage

First, ensure you have $GEM_HOME/bin in your path.
You'll need to set some environment variables to match your [xmlstats API key](https://erikberg.com/api#):
```
$ export XMLSTATS_API_KEY="xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
$ export XMLSTATS_CONTACT_INFO="you@example.com"
```
To cut down on API calls, you can turn on caching by setting these environment variables:
```
export XMLSTATS_CACHER='redis'
export XMLSTATS_REDIS_HOST='127.0.0.1'
```
where XMLSTATS_REDIS_HOST is the IP of a server running [redis](https://redis.io/) that you have access to. Most probably this is `127.0.0.1` and in fact if you don't specify this environment variable that value will be used.

Using the CLI is pretty straightforward.

All tasks accept the `--date` option which expects a date in `yyyyMMdd` format and will cause the results to reflect the given date.

### leader find
Use the `find` task to find the best team in baseball:

```
$ leader find --date 20190618
On the 18th day of June, 2019:
The Minnesota Twins are the leaders of the AL C division.
The Minnesota Twins are the leaders of the AL.
The Minnesota Twins are the best team in baseball.
```
You can also get some extra team stats with the `-s` option, and find the best team in a league or division. `leader -h find` provides the details:
```
$ leader -h find
Usage:
  leader find

Options:
  -s, [--stats=STATS]        # Include team stats in output.
  -l, [--league=LEAGUE]      # Find the league leader rather than overall best team.
                             # Possible values: AL, NL
  -d, [--division=DIVISION]  # Find the division leader rather than overall best team. Requires use of --league.
                             # Possible values: E, C, W
      [--date=DATE]          # The date for which to retrieve statistics. 'yyyyMMdd' format; default is current date. Statistics exist starting with the 2008 season.

Finds the best team in all of baseball, a league or a division.
```

### leader board
To query about a specific team, you'll need that team's ID. Get the full leaderboard with the `board` task, which includes each team's ID:
```
$ leader board
Team ID               Win%   W   L  Rank  League Rank  Div Rank   GB   Streak

You can also sort and filter by league and division. Use `leader -h board` for details:

  -L, [--only-league=ONLY_LEAGUE]                    # Only show results for this league.
                                                     # Possible values: AL, NL
  -d, [--sort-by-division], [--no-sort-by-division]  # Sort by league and division. Supercedes -l.
  -D, [--only-division=ONLY_DIVISION]                # Only show results for this division.
                                                     # Possible values: E, C, W
      [--date=DATE]                                  # The date for which to retrieve statistics. 'yyyyMMdd' format; default is current date. Statistics exist starting with the 2008 season.
