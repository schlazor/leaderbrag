# Leaderbrag

Leaderbrag is a small gem that uses [xmlstats](https://erikberg.com/api) to find the leading team in baseball or determine if a given team is the best in baseball. 

It includes the CLI executable `leader` which should be suitable for most scripting desires and also serves as a useful example for using the underlying library.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'leaderbrag'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install leaderbrag

## Usage

Using the CLI is pretty straightforward. Use the `find` task to find the best team in baseball:

```
$ leader find
The Minnesota Twins are the leaders of the AL C division.
The Minnesota Twins are the leaders of the AL.
The Minnesota Twins are the best team in baseball.
```

To query about a specific team, you'll need that team's ID. Get the list with the `list` task:
```
$ leader list

When asking about a team, the exit code indicates whether the requested team is the best team in baseball - 0 of so, otherwise it is the rank of that team in their division.
```
$ leader is minnesota-twins
The Minnesota Twins are the leaders of the AL C division.

The Minnesota Twins are the best team in baseball.
$ echo $?
