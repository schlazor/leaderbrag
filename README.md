# Leaderbrag [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/schlazor/leaderbrag.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/schlazor/leaderbrag)

Leaderbrag is a small gem that uses [xmlstats](https://erikberg.com/api) via [xmlstats-ruby](https://github.com/alexmchale/xmlstats-ruby) to find the leading team in baseball or determine if a given team is the best in baseball.

It includes the CLI executable `leader` which should be suitable for most scripting desires.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'leaderbrag'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install leaderbrag

## Usage

First, ensure you have $GEM_HOME/bin in your path.
You'll need to set some environment variables to match your [xmlstats API key](https://erikberg.com/api#):
```
$ export XMLSTATS_API_KEY="xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx"
$ export XMLSTATS_CONTACT_INFO="you@example.com"
```
To cut down on API calls, you can turn on caching by setting these environment variables:
```
export XMLSTATS_CACHER='redis'
export XMLSTATS_REDIS_HOST='127.0.0.1'
```
where XMLSTATS_REDIS_HOST is the IP of a server running [redis](https://redis.io/) that you have access to. Most probably this is `127.0.0.1` and in fact if you don't specify this environment variable that value will be used.

Using the CLI is pretty straightforward.

Use the `find` task to find the best team in baseball:

```
$ leader find
The Minnesota Twins are the leaders of the AL C division.
The Minnesota Twins are the leaders of the AL.
The Minnesota Twins are the best team in baseball.
```

To query about a specific team, you'll need that team's ID. Get the full leaderboard with the `board` task, which includes each team's ID:
```
$ leader board
